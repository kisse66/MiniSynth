# MiniSynth
Arduino based 4-voice multi-timbral mini synthesizer

Based on the_synth, "Arduino synth V4.1 Dzl/Illutron 2014", see the source code.

To build just open with Arduino IDE, choose Arduino pro mini 16MHz and build!

The code needs Arduino MIDI and EEPROM libraries and also my simple lib for TDI1400, that you can find from my github repo.
